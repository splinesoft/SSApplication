# SSApplication

[![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/splinesoft/SSApplication.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/splinesoft/SSApplication)

A `UIApplication` subclass to start your app off right.

`SSApplication` powers launch setup and app notifications in my app [MUDRammer - A Modern MUD Client for iPhone and iPad](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mudrammer-a-modern-mud-client/id597157072?mt=8).

# Setup

1. Install with [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/). Add to your Podfile:

    ```
    pod 'SSApplication', :head # YOLO
    ```
    
    Or just drag `SSApplication.{h,m}` into your project.

2. With `SSApplication` installed, edit your main app delegate file and subclass `SSApplication`:

    ```objc
    // MyAppDelegate.h
    #import <SSApplication.h>

    @interface MyAppDelegate : SSApplication
    @end
    ```

3. You'll need to make a small change in your app's `main.m` file to tell it about your new principal `UIApplication` subclass. Add your app delegate's class as the third argument to `UIApplicationMain`. Your `main.m` should look something like this:

    ```objc
    // main.m
    #import <UIKit/UIKit.h>
    #import "MyAppDelegate.h"

    int main(int argc, char *argv[])
    {
        @autoreleasepool {
            return UIApplicationMain(argc, 
                                     argv, 
                                     NSStringFromClass([MyAppDelegate class]), 
                                     NSStringFromClass([MyAppDelegate class]));
        }
    }
    ```

# App Launch

`SSApplication` helps set up your app at launch time by providing several methods you should override in your `SSApplication` subclass.

1. Kindly tell `SSApplication` about your root view controller, to be added to the main window (`SSApplication` creates a main application window for you).

    ```objc
    - (UIViewController *) ss_appRootViewController {
    	return [[UINavigationController alloc] initWithRootViewController:
    			[MyViewController new]];
    }
    ```


2. `SSApplication` implements `application:willFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` and passes launch arguments to your app delegate:


    ```objc
    - (void) ss_willFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)options {
     
        // Here I start analytics or other third party services
    }
    ```

3. `SSApplication` asks if there's any long-running setup to be performed on a background queue.

    ```objc
    - (void) ss_willLaunchBackgroundSetup {
        // This method is called asynchronously
        // on a background queue.
        // Here I do long-running setup
        // that doesn't need to finish immediately
    }
    ```
    
# Default NSUserDefaults

A handy way to set up default values in NSUserDefaults. Override `ss_defaultUserDefaults` and return a dictionary.

Each key in the dictionary you specify is checked against the keys already in `NSUserDefaults`, and any existing keys will NOT be overwritten. This allows you to specify defaults for user preferences and not overwrite any changes the user has made to those preferences.

It also allows you to introduce new preferences in an app update without having to worry about overwriting values in existing preferences.

```objc
- (NSDictionary *) ss_defaultUserDefaults {
	return @{
		@"A-Preference" : @1337,
		@"Another-Pref" : @"Threeve",
	};
}
```

# Notifications

The `UIApplicationDelegate` protocol informs your app delegate of a number of important app events, like moving between the background and foreground.

With `SSApplication`, several of these delegate calls are collapsed into a single method you can override.

```objc
- (void) ss_receivedApplicationEvent:(SSApplicationEvent)eventType {    
    NSLog(@"Event received: %i", eventType);

    switch (eventType) {
        case SSApplicationEventDidBecomeActive:
        case SSApplicationEventWillEnterForeground:
            
            // here I might start up an analytics service
            break;
            
        case SSApplicationEventDidEnterBackground:
        case SSApplicationEventWillResignActive:
            
            // here I might shut down an analytics service
            break;
            
        case SSApplicationEventWillTerminate:
            
            // here I might clean up core data
            break;
            
        case SSApplicationEventDidReceiveMemoryWarning:
            
            // memory warning!
            break;    
            
        default:
            break;
    }
}
```
